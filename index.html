<p>Captain America: Civil War is an enjoyable, but flawed follow-up to both Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron. It’s not nearly as powerful or gripping as TWS, but it also does a much better job of juggling so many different characters than AoU did.
</p>
<p>
World leaders demand oversight over Earth’s Mightiest Heroes after the costly and deadly events of the first Avengers, TWS, and AoU. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is for signing onto the Sokovia Accords, while Captain America (Chris Evans) is very much against it. After a deadly attack is attributed to Cap’s old partner, Bucky “The Winter Soldier” Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Cap goes rogue to locate and protect his oldest friend while Tony Stark and the Avengers who side with him are given a deadline to stop them before less friendly elements are sent after them. Superhero vs. superhero action ensues, as new heroes join the fray and a mysterious nemesis, Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), operates his own shadowy agenda
